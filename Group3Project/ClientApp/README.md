# Build-A-Grid
A sandbox game where you have the power! Build, operate, and destroy power plants and try to power your region.

Electricity demand and calculated power output for each fuel type is based on historical data from calls to the EIA Open Data API (https://www.eia.gov/opendata/index.php).
